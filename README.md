🕷️ What is This Project?
Web Scraper Tool is a Python-based utility that automatically extracts data from websites. It’s built to help users collect structured information from the internet quickly and efficiently — whether it’s for research, price monitoring, content aggregation, or SEO analysis.

✅ Supports both static and dynamic (JavaScript-loaded) websites
✅ Can be customized with target URL(s), tags, or keywords
✅ Outputs data in CSV, JSON, or Excel format
✅ Optional: Integrate with BeautifulSoup, Requests, or Selenium
